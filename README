SWFUpload
I came across the SWFUpload plugin when I was working a project for a client who wanted to allow up to 300 image file uploads per user.

What I liked
  * The ability to select multiple files in the file browser dialog
  * "Ajax style" multiple file uploads without refreshing the page.
  * SWFUpload fires several events during the upload process. 
    (the developer can use the events to update the UI and handle errors).
  * It is fast.
  * Its highly customizable.
  
What I didn't like
  * The UI of the available demos is not a friendly one when dealing with a lot of files.
  * Too much code for handling events
  * File upload limit is reset whenever the user refreshes the page
  * SWFUpload Object resets the file count everytime we open the browser file dialog box
  
What this demo does
I have taken the simple demo and thrown away excess code(namely, fileprogress.js) and re-written the event handler functions.
I have added the following features:
  
  * A progress bar that tracks the number of files uploaded
  * A counter for the number of files uploaded
  * A status update for current file being uploaded
  * JavaScript Cookie tracking that ensures the user does not exceed file upload limit
