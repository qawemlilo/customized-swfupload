The story.
I came across the SWFUpload plugin when I was working a project for a client who wanted to allow up to 300 image file uploads per user.

What's Nice?
  1. SWFUpload allows for multiple files uploads without refreshing the page.
  2. SWFUpload fires severals events during the upload process that (the developer the events to update the UI and and handle errors).
  3. It is fast.
  4. Files start uploading as soon as the user has finished selecting files.
  5. Its highly costomizable.
